# PWC-Virtual-Internship-Project-2-Churn-Data-Analysis

## Problem statement
The Retention Manager at PhoneNow has requested a dashboard for customer retention

## Task
Create a dashboard using the defined KPIs to reflect customer demographics and insights.
In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
We  have done customer analysis with Excel: but it has always ended in a dead-end
We would like to know more about our customers: visualized clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management

Write a concise email to the engagement partner explaining your findings and providing suggestions for necessary changes based on the dashboard you've created.

## Measures to define KPIs
Average TotalCharge, Churn count, SeniorCitizen%


## Action
First, analyze the data
Perform data exploration and data cleaning
Build a dashboard using Power BI to visualize data in such a way that important aspects of the business become very clear for the retention manager and can be used as a basis for discussion with the management
Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed


Tools Used - Microsoft Power BI, Excel
